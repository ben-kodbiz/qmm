      people of the Book.Unity and harmony among muslims and their strong
      organisation are essential.] --> B(Verses: 1 to 9: The first paragraph is introductory. The holy Quran is
      the criterion which exposes the interpolation of the people of the Book.
      The people of the Book especially the Christians are given the invitation of
      Tawheed  and Islam . The introduction of
      holy Quran has been given that it is the revelation of Allah like the Torah and
      the Injeel. It explains the difference between the right and the wrong. It is the
      criterion, Allah can fertilise the wombs as He wishes even without the father.
      The Christians went astray because they followed the allegorical verses.
      People have been advised to follow the attitude of the wise people regarding
      the decisive and the allegorical verses. Both the categorical and allegorical
      verses should be believed in, but the interpretation of allegorical verses should
      be avoided. Only those whose hearts are crooked get involved in the allegorical
      verses, The prayer to get rid of the crookedness of heart has been taught.);

      especially the Christians have been invited to Islam.);
      A --> D(Verses: 33 to 63: In the third paragraph, the true events of Maryam and Zakariyya  have been described to refute the Christian
      belief of Trinity.The invitation for mutual imprecation to prove the truth:
      If a Chnistian does not accept the invitation of Islam, in spite of all these
      arguments, he can be invited for mutual imprecation. We should come with our
      wives and children and they should come with their wives and children and say
      on oath that whoever is false should be cursed by Allah. In the end, the
      invitation of Tawheed has been given again.);
      A --> E(Verses: 64 to 101: In the fourth paragraph, the Muslims have been
      informed of the evil designs of the people of Book and have been
      advised to be on their guard.
      The people of the Book have been invited for a dialogue. Verse: 64
      Ibraaheem  was an upright Muslim. The Jews and Christians should
      follow the conduct of their glorious grandfather.
      The virtues and vices of the people of Book have been explained. They consider
      the misappropriation of the gentiles' property permissible for them.
      There are some good and honest people among them as well. The tampering of
      the Book by the Jewish scholars has been exposed that they move their tongues
      to give the impression that this commandment is in the Torah while it does not
      exist In it.
      The racial prejudice of Jews has been refuted. They want to believe only in the
      prophets belonging to their family; while the Muslims believe in all the
      prophets irrespective of their families. They are not prejudiced.
      The people of the Book have been told clearly that no other religion except
      Islam will be accepted.);

      ordered to fear Allah and they have been given organisational
      instructions,

      the rope of Allah collectively in the following words All together hold fast to the rope of Allah.There should be a group among
      the Muslims to invite people towards Islam, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.The invitation towards Islam and its propagation is a collective duty of
      Muslim Ummah.The Muslim nation is the best nation. Enjoining the good and forbidding the
      evil is its goal. The Muslim Ummah has been raised to convey the message of
      Islam to the mankind. Sympathy has been shown to the people of the Book by
      saying that it would have been better if they had accepted Islam. Verse: 110.
      After this, a few examples of the evil of the people of Book and the good
      which is hidden in them are given.
      Some people spend their wealth for gaining the benefits of this world instead of
      gaining the Pleasure of Allah; they have been warned of their end. The Muslims
      have been told not to trust the non-believers with their secrets.“O believers! Do not make intimate friendship with any but
      your own people.” Verse: 118
      This is the foreign policy of Islamic State. It has been made clear that the       Muslims love the people of the Book but they do not love the Muslims.);

      been criticised through a review of the defeat in the battle of Uhad.
      The weakness of two groups in the battle of Uhud has been mentioned.

      pious, avoid the usury, spend generously in the way of Allah, and obey Allah
      and His messenger . Surpass each other in achieving Allah's forgiveness
      and Paradise by charity and Jihad!“Rush towards forgiveness.”
       Those who believe, spend in the way of Allah both in prosperity and
      adversity. They control their anger and forgive people. Allah loves them.
      If they commit sin or indecency they seek Allah's forgiveness.
      They do not persist in sins. They will be given forgiveness and Paradise.
      Muslims have been given the consolation that they will be dominant if they
      believed. “And you will have the upper hand if you are
      the believers.” Verse: 139
      The purpose of defeat in Uhad has been clarified that Allah wanted to select the
      true believers. Verse: 140
      The advice to be patient and steadfast in the battlefield and strengthen the
      relationship with Allah has been given. );
      A --> I(Verses: 190 to 200: The seventh and last paragraph is the conclusion.
      It is the summary of the whole soorah.
       The wise people have been advised to ponder over the mysteries of the
      universe and enhance their relationship with Allah.
       The command to obey the messenger  of Allah has been given.
       Those who show steadfastness in migration, charity, Jihad and sufferings

unbelievers in the land.” Verse: 196

been given as a summary.

 mutual persuasion for steadfastness,
readiness and 
Piety fear of Allah and guarding the limits set by Him.

“O believers! Be patient, excel in patience during confrontation, hold
yourself ready for battle and have fear of Allah so that you may be successful.”Verse: 200

Al-Baqarah which has also been mentioned in verse 147 of soorah A
“Give us victory over the unbelievers.”
These four plans are the guarantee of victory against the unbelievers.);
