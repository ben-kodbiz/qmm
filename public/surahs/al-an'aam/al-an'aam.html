    Oneness of God
      No partners
      Creator of all
      All-Knowing
      All-Powerful
    Disbelievers
      Rejection of truth
      Arrogance
      Blindly following ancestors
      Demand for miracles
      Ingratitude
    Arguments Against Polytheism
      False deities have no power
      Idols cannot create
      Rejection of intercession
    Consequences of Disbelief
      Punishment in the Hereafter
      Loss and ruin
      Spiritual blindness
    Hereafter
      Day of Judgement
      Resurrection
      Rewards and punishments
    Prohibitions
      Killing unjustly
      Falsehood
      Associating partners with God
      Following desires blindly
    Messengers
      Role as warners and bearers of good tidings
      Rejected by their people
      Confirmation of previous messengers
   Personal Responsibility
      Each soul bears its own burden
      No excuse for wrongdoing
    Purpose of Life
      A test from God
      Opportunity to earn reward
    Idol Worship
      Folly and ignorance
      Condemnation of idolatry
    God's Signs
      In creation
      In the alternation of night and day
      In the self
